In preparing maps showing the geographic distribution of North American microtines, conflicting statements in the literature and identifications that, if accepted, would result in improbable geographic ranges have led to the examination of pertinent specimens with the results given below. The studies here reported upon were aided by a contract between the Office of Naval Research, Department of the Navy, and the University of Kansas (Nr 161-791), by funds provided by the University of Kansas from its Research Appropriation, and by grants for out-of-state field work from the Kansas University Endowment Association. Grateful acknowledgment is made to persons in charge of the collections at each of the following institutions for permission to use the collections under their charge: Biological Surveys Collection, United States National Museum (herein abbreviated USBS); California Museum of Vertebrate Zoology (MVZ); Chicago Natural History Museum (CNHM); University of Kansas Museum of Natural History (KU); Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ); United States National Museum (USNM); Department of Economic Zoology, University of Wisconsin (UWDEZ); and Zoological Museum, University of Wisconsin (UWZM).

1942.
<i>
Synaptomys cooperi saturatus
</i>
Bole and Moulthrop, Sci. Publs. Cleveland Mus. Nat. Hist., 5:149, September 11, type from Bloomington, McLean County, Illinois.
</p>
</div>
<p>
When Bole and Moulthrop named
<i>
Synaptomys cooperi saturatus</i>, with type locality in Illinois, they, in effect, divided the geographic range of
<i>
Synaptomys cooperi stonei
</i>
into two parts (see A. B. Howell, N. Amer. Fauna, 50:10 (fig. 2), August 5, 1927) since Bole and Moulthrop (<i>op. cit.</i>) did not assign to any subspecies the specimens from southern Wisconsin that Howell (<i>op. cit.</i>) had identified as
<i>
S. c. stonei</i>. Bole and Moulthrop's inclusion in their newly named subspecies of a specimen from as far west as East Columbia, Missouri, left in doubt the subspecific identity of specimens from Iowa and a specimen from Arkansas. Howell (<i>op. cit.</i>) had assigned this material from Iowa and Arkansas to
<i>
S. c. gossii</i>.
</p>
<p>
Howell recognized that the one individual (168266 USBS) from Lake City, Arkansas, was too young to be identified to subspecies with certainty and assigned the specimen to
<i>
S. c. gossii
</i>
"upon geographical grounds" (<i>op. cit.</i>:19). Keith R. Kelson and one of us (Hall) compared this specimen with pertinent materials. As a result of this comparison we refer the specimen, on the same grounds employed by Howell, to
<i>
Synaptomys cooperi saturatus</i>.
</p>
<p>
Specimens from approximately the southern half of Wisconsin (from Kelly Lake southward) were referred to
<i>
S. c. stonei
</i>
by Howell (<i>op. cit.</i>:16). Now that
<i>
S. c. saturatus
</i>
has been recognized, these specimens from southern Wisconsin would be expected to be referable to
<i>
S. c. saturatus</i>. When these specimens were examined and compared (by Hall and Kelson) with other specimens in the United States National Museum the skulls were found to be much larger than in
<i>
S. c. cooperi</i>, smaller than in
<i>
S. c. gossii</i>, and nearly the size of those of
<i>
Synaptomys cooperi saturatus</i>, to which subspecies we refer the specimens in question.
</p>
<p>
Howell (<i>op. cit.</i>:16) referred a specimen from Cassopolis, Michigan, a locality that might be presumed to fall within the range of the more recently named
<i>
S. c. saturatus</i>, to
<i>
S. c. stonei</i>. Bole and Moulthrop did not mention this specimen when they described and named
<i>
S. c. saturatus
</i>
(1942). Neither did Burt, but Cassopolis is within the geographic range ascribed to
<i>
S. c. cooperi
</i>
on his map (The Mammals of Michigan, Univ. Michigan Press, p. 213, 1946). Examination (by Kelson and Hall) of the specimen (41777 MCZ) reveals that it resembles
<i>
S. c. cooperi
</i>
in shortness of hind foot (18 mm.), shortness of tail (18 mm.), narrowness across zygomata (16 mm.), and grayish pelage. In the long braincase, heavy rostrum, greater condylobasilar length, greater lambdoidal breadth, long rostrum, and longer incisive foramina, it agrees closely with specimens of
<i>
S. c. saturatus</i>, to which subspecies we refer the specimen.
</p>
<p>
Necker and Hatfield (Bull. Chicago Acad. Sci., 6:54, 1941) referred specimens from Rosiclaire, Illinois, to
<i>
S. c. gossii</i>. These specimens were not mentioned by Bole and Moulthrop (<i>op. cit.</i>) when they named
<i>
S. c. saturatus
</i>
although the specimens presumably would be referred to the newly-named subspecies. We have examined the pertinent specimens (Nos. 15781-15786 and 16049-16054 CNHM) and find that on the basis of dark color, long and slender skull, heavy incisors, and small cheek-teeth, they are referable to
<i>
S. c. saturatus
</i>
Bole and Moulthrop. None, however, has a tail so short as the type of
<i>
S. c. saturatus</i>. For that matter, the average length of the tail of six near topotypes (5 mi. W, 2&#189; mi. S Monticello, Piatt County, Illinois, Nos. 32037-32042 KU) exceeds that of the type (17.4 mm., range 12-20, as compared to 14 mm. for the type).

<p>
In view of the taxonomic treatment accorded by Bole and Moulthrop (Sci. Publs. Cleveland Mus. Nat. Hist, 5:149-151, September 11, 1942) to the lemming mice of the species
<i>
Synaptomys cooperi</i>, as explained in the preceding account, it has seemed desirable to examine Iowan specimens of this species. Hall and Kelson examined the necessary material and made the following conclusions. An adult male from Hillsboro (168453 USBS) has the lighter color and large skull of
<i>
S. c. gossii
</i>
to which Howell (N. Amer. Fauna, 50:19, August 5, 1927) referred the specimen. The more western specimen from Knoxville, a young male (190358 USNM), is almost exactly the same age as a male of
<i>
S. c. saturatus
</i>
from Bascom, Indiana (143701 USNM), and is but slightly older than a male
<i>
S. c. gossii
</i>
from Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas (91583 USBS). The upper molariform tooth-row is the same length in the specimens from Kansas and Iowa, but is longer in that from Indiana. The fact that the specimen from Knoxville closely resembles the Kansan specimen in other dimensions of the skull, which is larger than in the specimen from Indiana, gives a basis for applying the name
<i>
Synaptomys cooperi gossii
</i>
to the specimen from Knoxville. This is the same name recently used by Fichter and Hansen (Bull. Univ. Nebraska State Mus., 3(2):2, September, 1947) for the Iowan specimens, although they seemingly applied the name without being aware of Bole and Moulthrop's earlier naming of
<i>
S. c. saturatus
</i>
(Sci. Publs. Cleveland Mus. Nat. Hist., 5:149, September 11, 1942).

</p>
</div>
<p>
Howell (N. Amer. Fauna, 50:30-31, August 5, 1927) had only eight specimens of this subspecies available when he revised the genus
<i>
Synaptomys</i>. Of these eight (Maine: Mount Katahdin, 2; New Brunswick: Near Bathurst, 1; New Hampshire: Fabyans, 1, the type; Quebec: St. Rose, 4), only the type and one of the specimens from St. Rose are adults. Concerning the others, Howell wrote (<i>op. cit.</i>:31): "The example from near Bathurst is not adult and has a damaged skull, so is identified provisionally. All other specimens are too young for positive diagnosis."
</p>
<p>
Since Howell's revision only one additional specimen has been reported. Anderson (Ann. Rept. Provancher Soc. for 1939, p. 71, 1940) reported it from Table Mountain, 3888 ft., Gasp&#233; County, Quebec.
</p>
<p>
In the collection of the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History there is still another specimen. It is an adult male topotype (No. 6483 KU, formerly No. 72 in the collection of Alfred E. Preble) obtained on August 21, 1905, at Fabyans, New Hampshire. The measurements of this specimen are as follows (measurements in parenthesis are those of the type as given by Howell,
<i>
op. cit.</i>): Total length, 135 (132); tail, 26 (24); hind foot, 22 (20); condylobasilar length, 25.1 (25.8); rostral length, 6.5 (6.8); rostral breadth, 4.7 (4.9); interorbital breadth, 3.3 (2.8); zygomatic breadth, 15.4 (16.0); lambdoidal breadth, 12.1 (12.4); incisive foramina, 5.9 (5.7); height of skull, 9.1 (9.3).
</p>
<p>
Howell (<i>op. cit.</i>:30) characterized
<i>
S. b. sphagnicola
</i>
as: "Large and high [skull] with narrow interorbital sharply ridged, the ridges of the type being joined for a distance of 4 millimeters; interparietal narrow and rectangular. The rostrum is long, tapering very little, and the nasals, slightly constricted medially are quite narrow posteriorly. The incisive foramina are long and wide." Howell further stated (<i>op. cit.</i>:30-31) that: "It is hard to predict what will be found to constitute the most valuable cranial characters in distinguishing this race from adult
<i>
medioximus</i>. The discernible differences now are in the shape of the interparietals, rostral characters, and interorbital differences that will probably not hold good when animals of the same age are compared."
</p>
<p>
As can be seen from a comparison of the measurements given above for the type and the topotype, some of the characteristics given by Howell are not found in the topotype: The interorbital region is not narrow (in fact it is wider than it ordinarily is in some other subspecies of
<i>
Synaptomys borealis</i>) and the incisive foramina are not longer than in other subspecies of
<i>
Synaptomys borealis</i>.
</p>
<p>
As far as present material permits us to judge,
<i>
Synaptomys borealis sphagnicola
</i>
is characterized, cranially, by: Skull large; interorbital region sharply ridged (the ridges being joined for a distance of 4 mm. in the type and of 4.5 mm. in the topotype); rostrum long, tapering relatively little; nasals slightly constricted medially and unusually narrow posteriorly; interparietal narrow and rectangular.

Clethrionomys gapperi caurinus</i>, Racey and Cowan, Rept. British Columbia Prov. Mus. for 1935, p. H 25.
</p>
</div>
<p>
Prior to 1935
<i>
caurinus
</i>
was considered to be a monotypic species. In 1935 Racey and Cowan (Rept. British Columbia Provincial Museum for 1935, pp. H 25-H 26) examined material from southwestern British Columbia of
<i>
C. caurinus</i>, including a series of 24 specimens from Alta Lake, and compared it with
<i>
Clethrionomys gapperi occidentalis
</i>
and
<i>
C. g. saturatus</i>. They found
<i>
caurinus
</i>
to be distinct from
<i>
C. g. saturatus
</i>
but were "not convinced that
<i>
occidentalis
</i>
and
<i>
caurinus
</i>
both merit systematic recognition; should they prove to be indistinguishable, as the little available material indicates,
<i>
occidentalis
</i>
will take precedence on grounds of priority. It is our opinion that further study of the distribution of the genus in British Columbia will lead to the recognition of
<i>
occidentalis
</i>
as the form inhabiting coast-line and
<i>
saturatus
</i>
the interior of British Columbia" p. H 26. In the face of these opinions Racey and Cowan nevertheless recognized
<i>
caurinus
</i>
under the name
<i>
Clethrionomys gapperi caurinus
</i>
(Bailey).
</p>
<p>
In spite of the treatment by Racey and Cowan (<i>op. cit.</i>) of
<i>
occidentalis
</i>
and
<i>
caurinus
</i>
as subspecies of
<i>
C. gapperi</i>, later authors arranged
<i>
occidentalis
</i>
as a member of the "<i>californicus</i>" group although they retained
<i>
caurinus
</i>
in the
<i>
gapperi
</i>
group. For example, Davis (The Recent Mammals of Idaho, The Caxton Printers, pp. 307-308, 1939) assigned
<i>
C. caurinus
</i>
to the
<i>
gapperi
</i>
group, although he regarded
<i>
C. caurinus
</i>
as a species (not a subspecies). He regarded also
<i>
C. occidentalis
</i>
as a species (not a subspecies) but assigned it to the
<i>
californicus
</i>
group. Dalquest (Univ. Kansas Publ., Mus. Nat. Hist., 2:344, April 9, 1948) considered
<i>
occidentalis
</i>
to be conspecific with
<i>
Clethrionomys californicus
</i>
and wrote (<i>op. cit.</i>:101): "The
<i>
californicus
</i>
group, I feel, contains only the races of
<i>
Clethrionomys californicus</i>, while the
<i>
gapperi
</i>
group contains
<i>
C. gapperi
</i>
and its races, including
<i>
caurinus</i>, and possible other species." Dalquest gave no indication that he had examined any specimens of
<i>
caurinus</i>.
</p>
<p>
When Dalquest (<i>op. cit.</i>:344) arranged
<i>
occidentalis
</i>
and
<i>
californicus
</i>
as subspecies of the same species, he used the name combination
<i>
Clethrionomys californicus occidentalis
</i>
because he ignored, or was unaware of, the page priority of
<i>
occidentalis
</i>
over
<i>
californicus</i>. We regard the anterior position of
<i>
occidentalis
</i>
as nomenclatural priority and therefore employ
<i>
occidentalis
</i>
rather than
<i>
californicus
</i>
as the specific name.
</p>
<p>
Differences between the
<i>
gapperi
</i>
group and the
<i>
occidentalis
</i>
group include: postpalatal bridge (complete in both groups) truncate posteriorly in the
<i>
gapperi
</i>
group and with a median, posteriorly directed, spine in the
<i>
occidentalis
</i>
group (this character is not evident in all specimens; some
<i>
gapperi
</i>
have a spine, and some
<i>
occidentalis
</i>
have the spine much reduced); dentition of the
<i>
occidentalis
</i>
group is heavier; enamel pattern of M3 and m1 in
<i>
occidentalis
</i>
more simplified&#8212;the number of salient and re-entrant angles tends to be reduced in adults of the
<i>
occidentalis
</i>
group.
</p>
<p>
An examination of specimens of
<i>
caurinus
</i>
(British Columbia: Mt. Seymour, 2 KU; Lund, Malaspina Inlet, 2 USBS; and Inverness, mouth Skeena River, 1 USBS), reveals that, in the presence of the median postpalatal spine and in the characters of the molars,
<i>
caurinus
</i>
agrees with the
<i>
occidentalis
</i>
group.

</div>
<p>
The red-backed mouse of the Olympic Peninsula was originally accorded specific rank. Currently it stands in the literature as a subspecies of the wide-spread species
<i>
Clethrionomys gapperi
</i>
because Dalquest (Univ. Kansas Publ. Mus. Nat. Hist., 2:343, April 9, 1948) used the name-combination
<i>
Clethrionomys gapperi nivarius</i>. Taylor and Shaw had earlier (Occas. Papers Charles R. Conner Mus., 2:23, 1929) indicated the same status by using the name
<i>
Evotomys gapperi nivarius</i>. Davis (The Recent Mammals of Idaho, The Caxton Printers, Caldwell, Idaho, p. 306, April 5, 1939), however, indicated that the affinities of
<i>
nivarius
</i>
were with the
<i>
californicus
</i>
[=
<i>
occidentalis</i>] group, although he treated
<i>
nivarius
</i>
as a distinct species. We have examined two adult females (K. U. Nos. 10707 and 10708) of
<i>
nivarius
</i>
from Reflection Lake, 3800 ft., Jefferson County, Washington, and on the basis of their thick, instead of thin, pterygoid processes concur with Davis that the affinities of
<i>
nivarius
</i>
are with the named kinds of
<i>
Clethrionomys
</i>
now arranged as subspecies of
<i>
Clethrionomys occidentalis</i>, rather than with the kinds now arranged as subspecies of
<i>
Clethrionomys gapperi</i>. Although we are aware that Dalquest (<i>op. cit.</i>:101-102) did not find actual intergradation between
<i>
nivarius
</i>
and
<i>
Clethrionomys occidentalis occidentalis</i>&#8212;a ten-mile gap separated their ranges&#8212;we prefer to use the name combination
<i>
Clethrionomys occidentalis nivarius</i>. In doing so we recognize that intergradation ultimately may be found between the two species
<i>
C. occidentalis
</i>
and
<i>
C. gapperi</i>; in that event the name
<i>
gapperi
</i>
will apply as the name of the species because it has priority over
<i>
occidentalis</i>.

<p>
The name
<i>
rufescens</i>, as applied by R. W. Smith (Amer. Midland Nat., 24:233, July, 1940) to the red-backed mouse of Nova Scotia, seems to be unavailable under the rules of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, since it is a homonym of
<i>
Arvicola rufescens

de Selys Longchamps, 1836, which in turn is a synonym of
<i>
Clethrionomys glareolus glareolus

Swarth, Univ. California Publ. Zool., 7:127, January 12, type from Marten Arm, Boca de Quadra, Alaska.
</p>
</div>
<p>
When Swarth (<i>loc. cit.</i>) named the red-backed mouse of the mainland of southern Alaska as a new subspecies, he characterized it as "Size rather large. Differs from
<i>
E.
</i>
[=
<i>
Clethrionomys</i>]
<i>
wrangeli</i>, nearest it geographically, in cranial characters and in much longer tail; from
<i>
E. caurinus</i>, the species to the southward in British Columbia, in larger size and longer tail." He remarked (<i>loc. cit.</i>): "I had supposed that the red-backed mouse occurring on the mainland coast of this region would prove to be
<i>
E. wrangeli</i>, but the latter appears to be purely an insular species. I have had no specimens of that race for comparison, but the
<i>
Evotomys
</i>
secured differ so widely from it in all the essential peculiarities of the species as given in the published descriptions that there seems little doubt of their belonging to a different species.
<i>
Wrangeli
</i>
has a short tail, less than twice as long as the hind foot&#8212;in adults of
<i>
phaeus
</i>
the tail is invariably more than twice the length of the foot, frequently more than a third of the entire length of the animal."
</p>
<p>
The external and cranial measurements of two subadults in the United States National Museum (No. 217413 from Quadra Lake and No. 217415 from Marten Arm, Boca de Quadra, taken in mid-February) and three old adults from Fort [= Port] Simpson, British Columbia (Nos. 90263-90264, 90272 USBS), are almost the same as those given by Swarth in the original description of
<i>
Clethrionomys phaeus</i>.
</p>
<p>
In cranial measurements, as well as in the structure of the palate and last upper molar,
<i>
C. phaeus
</i>
agrees with the
<i>
gapperi
</i>
group (to which it has been assigned by Davis, The Recent Mammals of Idaho, The Caxton Printers, p. 306, April 5, 1939, and by Orr, Jour. Mamm., 26:69, February 12, 1945) and differs from
<i>
Clethrionomys occidentalis caurinus
</i>
(which was assigned above to the
<i>
occidentalis
</i>
group, formerly the
<i>
californicus
</i>
group).
</p>
<p>
Since the measurements of specimens examined by us, as well as those recorded by Swarth (<i>op. cit.</i>), fall within the range of those of the species
<i>
Clethrionomys gapperi</i>, and since the differences between
<i>
phaeus
</i>
and
<i>
C. g. saturatus
</i>
are of the kind and degree that separate subspecies in
<i>
C. gapperi
</i>
we employ the name combination
<i>
Clethrionomys gapperi phaeus
</i>
(Swarth).
<i>
C. g. saturatus</i>, as understood by us, occurs to the southeast of
<i>
C. g. phaeus
</i>
in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia, and in northeastern Washington, northern Idaho and northwestern Montana.

Bailey, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 11:120, May 13, type from Wrangell, Wrangell Island, Alaska.
</p>
</div>
<p>
When Bailey (<i>loc. cit.</i>) named the red-backed mouse from Wrangell Island, Alaska, he characterized it as "A large, dull-colored species entirely distinct from any known form," and remarked: "In no way does
<i>
E.
</i>
[=
<i>
Clethrionomys</i>]
<i>
wrangeli
</i>
show a close relationship to any other American species. In size and relative proportions it comes closest to
<i>
E. dawsoni</i>, from which it differs widely in coloration and more widely in cranial characters. With the long-tailed species south and east of its range there is no need of comparison."
</p>
<p>
Swarth (Univ. California Publ. Zool., 24:173, June 17, 1922) reported that three specimens from Flood Glacier and 23 from Great Glacier, British Columbia, and four from Sergief Island, at the mouth of the Stikine River, Alaska, were: "All
<i>
E. wrangeli</i>, indistinguishable from specimens at hand from Wrangell Island." Swarth further reported that, although he found no intergradation between
<i>
Clethrionomys wrangeli
</i>
from Flood Glacier and the nearly adjacent
<i>
Clethrionomys rutilus dawsoni</i>, "the two species, however, resemble each other so closely in form, and in some pelages in color also, that
<i>
wrangeli
</i>
would seem to be a coastal offshoot of
<i>
dawsoni</i>...."
</p>
<p>
Davis (The Recent Mammals of Idaho, The Caxton Printers, p. 306, April 5, 1939) and Orr (Jour. Mamm., 26:69, February 12, 1945) more recently have shown that
<i>
Clethrionomys wrangeli
</i>
is not a member of the
<i>
rutilus
</i>
group (to which
<i>
C. dawsoni
</i>
belongs) but is a member of the
<i>
gapperi
</i>
group.
</p>
<p>
Our comparisons of a series of eight topotypes of
<i>
wrangeli
</i>
(all in the Biological Surveys Collection) with several subspecies of
<i>
Clethrionomys gapperi
</i>
(including
<i>
phaeus</i>,
<i>
saturatus</i>,
<i>
galei</i>,
<i>
brevicaudus</i>, and others) reveal that the differences seen in
<i>
wrangeli
</i>
are of the kind and degree that serve to separate subspecies. The red-backed mouse from Wrangell Island, then, should stand as
<i>
Clethrionomys gapperi wrangeli
</i>
(Bailey).

but cast doubt upon their subspecific identity. He also reported pine mice from Blue Mounds, Dane County, Wisconsin. We have examined these specimens (Westpoint, Columbia County, 2&#8212;No. 544, skin only, UWDEZ, and No. 521, skin only, H. C. Hanson's private collection; Westpoint, Dane County, 1, No. 11620, UWZM; Vermont, Dane County, 2, Nos. 11674 and 11694, UWZM) and have compared them with topotypes of

Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 5:73, April 28, type from Aztec, 5900 ft., San Juan County, New Mexico.
</p>
</div>
<p>
Allen (<i>loc. cit.</i>) described this species on the basis of two specimens from Aztec, New Mexico, and three from La Plata, New Mexico. He characterized it as "Size large; pelage very full and soft; tail short; skull very narrow.
</p>
<p>
"Above grayish brown with a tinge of pale buff; fur blackish plumbeous beneath the surface, tipped with pale yellowish brown, and varied with longer, projecting, black-tipped hairs; below grayish white, the fur plumbeous beneath the surface and tipped with white, giving a whitish gray effect. Feet dusky; tail dusky brown above, dull white below."
</p>
<p>
Allen identified as this species "a large
<i>
Arvicola
</i>
from Estes Park, Colorado, which I have before been unable to allocate. I am unable to find that it differs in any particular from the specimens from New Mexico." He pointed out also (<i>op. cit.</i>:73-74) that "The type and only positively identified specimen of Baird's
<i>
Arvicola modesta
</i>
[=
<i>
Microtus pennsylvanicus modestus
</i>
(Baird)] from Sawatche Pass, Colorado, is a very young specimen in poor condition. An examination of a series of adult and young examples from the type locality will be necessary in order to determine its relationships to
<i>
A. alticolus
</i>
[=
<i>
Microtus longicaudus alticolus
</i>
(Merriam)] and
<i>
A. aztecus</i>."
</p>
<p>
Bailey, in his revision of the American voles of the genus
<i>
Microtus
</i>
(N. Amer. Fauna, 17:20), showed
<i>
Arvicola modesta
</i>
Baird to be a subspecies of
<i>
Microtus pennsylvanicus
</i>
but retained
<i>
Microtus aztecus
</i>
(Allen) as a distinct species. In describing
<i>
M. aztecus
</i>
he wrote "the size similar to
<i>
M. pennsylvanicus</i>, but with shorter tail and larger hindfoot; skull long; braincase narrow; interparietal long ..." and remarked that "<i>Microtus aztecus
</i>
belongs to the
<i>
pennsylvanicus
</i>
group. Externally it is not very different from
<i>
modestus</i>, but none of the specimens show any signs of intergradation; and the skull characters are so well marked that there seems no doubt of its full specific rank."
</p>
<p>
Subsequent to the publication of Allen's (<i>op. cit.</i>) account and Bailey's account (<i>op. cit.</i>), additional material was collected that helps to clarify the relationships of
<i>
Microtus aztecus</i>. A comparison of six adult topotypes of
<i>
Microtus aztecus
</i>
with a series of nine adults of
<i>
M. p. modestus
</i>
from 1 mi. S, 2 mi. E Eagle Nest, 8100 ft., Colfax County, New Mexico, with three adults from 1&#189; mi. E Manassa, Conejos County, Colorado, and with four adults from Saguache County, Colorado (all in KU), reveals that the supposed "well marked" external and cranial differences between the two forms are not nearly so evident as was indicated by Bailey.
</p>
<p>
The cranial differences that exist between these two forms (narrower nasals, slightly longer interparietal, slightly longer and narrower skull in
<i>
aztecus</i>) are evident only as averages. Although geographically intermediate specimens are lacking, the morphological differences between the two kinds of animals are of the degree and kind that separate subspecies, rather than species. We therefore judge
<i>
M. aztecus
</i>
(Allen) to be only subspecifically distinct from
<i>
M. pennsylvanicus modestus
</i>
and employ the name
<i>
Microtus pennsylvanicus aztecus</i>.

<p>
When Murie (Jour. Mamm., 11:75, February 11, 1930) named the meadow mouse from Amak Island, Alaska, as
<i>
amakensis</i>, he arranged it as a separate species. One of us (Hall) and K. R. Kelson examined the type and topotypes of
<i>
amakensis
</i>
in the Biological Surveys collection in the U. S. National Museum and compared them with series of
<i>
Microtus oeconomus operarius</i>,
<i>
M. o. sitkensis</i>,
<i>
M. o. elymocetes</i>,
<i>
M. o. yakutatensis</i>, and
<i>
M. o. kadiacensis</i>. Among the specimens examined of the latter subspecies were 17 from Izambek Bay, Kodiak Peninsula, on the mainland opposite Amak Island, the type locality of
<i>
amakensis</i>. The characters given by Murie (<i>op. cit.</i>) serve to separate
<i>
amakensis
</i>
from closely related neighboring kinds of meadow mice, but are of the degree and kind that, in this group of meadow mice, separate subspecies rather than species. Although actual intergrades are lacking, the animals from Amak Island are considered to be only subspecifically distinct and to belong to the
<i>
oeconomus
</i>
complex. The name
<i>
Microtus oeconomus amakensis

is applied to them.

Dalquest (Univ. Kansas Publ., Mus. Nat. Hist., 2:353, April 9, 1948) assigned all the meadow mice of the species
<i>
Microtus longicaudus
</i>
from approximately the eastern half of Washington State to
<i>
Microtus longicaudus halli
</i>
Hayman and Holt and, in doing so, excluded the subspecies
<i>
Microtus longicaudus mordax
</i>
from that state. This assignment of specimens in Washington had the effect of separating the geographic range of
<i>
M. l. mordax
</i>
into two parts. One part was in south-central British Columbia and the other part was mainly in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. Hall and Kelson examined specimens in the Biological Surveys collection in the U. S. National Museum in an attempt to determine more precisely the ranges of the subspecies in southern Canada, Washington, and Idaho.
</p>
<p>
<i>
Microtus longicaudus angustus
</i>
[=
<i>
M. l. halli</i>] was described by one of us (Hall, Univ. California Publ. Zool., 37:13, April 10, 1931) as differing from
<i>
mordax
</i>
in narrower braincase, higher skull near the anterior end of the frontals, darker coloration, and seemingly smaller size. After examining the material in the U. S. National Museum no reason is seen at the present time to amend this characterization, except to add that some specimens of
<i>
M. l. mordax
</i>
are as dark as seasonably comparable specimens of
<i>
M. l. halli</i>.
</p>
<p>
Examination of specimens of
<i>
Microtus longicaudus
</i>
from Washington east of the Cascade Range (those from the Blue Mountain area excepted) discloses that the skulls do not differ essentially from those of topotypes of
<i>
M. l. mordax</i>, but do differ, as outlined above, from near-topotypes of
<i>
M. l. halli</i>. There is considerable variation in color among the Washington-taken specimens of
<i>
Microtus longicaudus</i>. Animals from the eastern flanks of the Cascades average darker than those taken, north of the Snake River, still farther east in Washington. Possibly Dalquest (<i>op. cit.</i>) relied mainly upon this darker color in assigning the specimens from eastern Washington to
<i>
M. l. halli</i>. Relying principally upon cranial characters, we conclude that most of the specimens are better referred to
<i>
M. l. mordax
</i>
and that
<i>
M. l. halli
</i>
is restricted, in Washington, to the Blue Mountains.

<p>
Rausch (Jour. Washington Acad. Sci., 40:135, April 21, 1950) proposed the name

Microtus miurus paneaki</i>, with type locality at Tolugak Lake (lat. 68&#176; 24&#8242; N, long. 152&#176; 10&#8242; W), Brooks Range, Alaska, for a meadow mouse of the subgenus
<i>
Stenocranius</i>. This place is only approximately forty miles east and north of the type locality of the earlier named
<i>
Microtus muriei</i>, also a member of the subgenus
<i>
Stenocranius</i>. Large series of specimens of this subgenus, from the Arctic Slope of Alaska, are in the Museum of Natural History of the University of Kansas. Study of these indicates that the differences, which Rausch (<i>op. cit.</i>:136) described as distinguishing his
<i>
M. m. paneaki
</i>
from
<i>
M. muriei</i>, result from differences in age of the specimens, and possibly in part from differences in seasonal condition of pelage. For example, Rausch thought that
<i>
M. m. paneaki
</i>
was larger than
<i>
M. muriei
</i>
but our specimens reveal that such is not the case. The measurements given below of the type specimen of
<i>
M. muriei
</i>
(after Nelson, original description) and measurements (in parentheses) of an immature female (43807 K. U.) of
<i>
Microtus miurus muriei
</i>

Total length, 119 (122); tail vertebrae, 24 (24); hind foot, 20 (20); condylobasal length, 24.3 (24.5); zygomatic breadth, 10.7 (11.0); greatest width of braincase, 9.0 (9.0); length of nasals, 6.5 (6.0); basal width of rostrum, 4.0 (4.3). In the light of all of the evidence now available, it seems best to treat
<i>
Microtus miurus paneaki
</i>

<i>
Microtus muriei
</i>
Nelson.
</p>
<p>
Quay (Jour. Mamm., 32:95, February 15, 1951) identified fifty-eight specimens from the Seward Peninsula of Alaska as
<i>
Microtus miurus oreas
</i>
Osgood. Through the courtesy of Dr. Charles P. Lyman, fifteen of Quay's specimens in the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College have been examined by one of us (Hall). These specimens are as follows: Lava Lake (43378, 43379, 43381, 43382, 43386, 43467 and 43478); Mt. Boyan (43384, 43385, 43463 and 43477); Anvil Hill [= Peak], Cooper Gulch (43377, 43464 and 43473); &#8212;&#8212;? Lake, 43383. Although we are not prepared to say that these specimens are
<i>
M. m. muriei</i>, they seem to resemble
<i>
M. m. muriei
</i>
as closely as they do any other named form and we here refer them to that subspecies.
</p>
<p>
The facts are that a critical taxonomic study of the American specimens of the subgenus
<i>
Stenocranius
</i>
is required in order to ascertain the geographic variation. One of us (Hall) has examined the holotypes of the kinds named from Alaska, and the material listed by R. Baker (Univ. Kansas Publ. Mus. Nat. Hist., 5:109) of the two kinds named from Canada. The degree and nature of the variation shown by these specimens lead us to the conclusion that all are of a single species. If the American mouse is specifically distinct from any of the previously named Asiatic species&#8212;at this writing we lack material to decide this question&#8212;the named kinds from the mainland of the New World may stand as follows:

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
